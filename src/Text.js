                We people, have many things to get happy in our lives. But many
                times we could
                <span style={{ color: "lightgreen" }}>have difficulties </span>
                finding them.
                According to me,
                <span style={{ color: "lightgreen" }}>
                  the more we try, the easier it becomes to find them
                </span>
                . If I come to me, I interest in playing piano, watching
                              movies.My favorite movie is Interstellar.I literally love that movie.
                              In fact, my interest in piyano has started thanks to Interstellar.
                              This is my goal. I set a goal after I watched this movie. Now I can play Interstellar soundtrack without knowing the notes, thank God.
                              but I dont like series.
                              Actually one or two times I have
                tried to watch series before such as dark, but I couldnt
                continue. I guest I must not a series person, Ä±dk. And I do
                fitness, rarely swimming and playing table tennis especially
                beginning of the my university life. I literally enjoy talking
                about philosophy, but not in English. because I dont think I
